# image_disk


## Introduction
I use this to make an image online
so that we have access to the image 
as long as we heve the web link.

## Steps:

* Create and upload your repo on github 
    
    **Make sure you have pushed your local images to remote repo**
* get the raw address

```

```

As for me, it's
```
![](https://raw.githubusercgntent.com/iamwrm/image_disk/master/avator.jpg)
```

Then my avator image shows up
