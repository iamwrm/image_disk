# image_disk


## Introduction
I use this to make an image online
so that we have access to the image 
as long as we heve the web link.

## Steps:

1. Create and upload your repo on github 
    
    **Make sure you have pushed your local images to remote repo**
2. deduce the raw address and insert the link

```
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/projectname/branch/path/to/img.png)
```

As for me, it's
```
![](https://raw.githubusercgntent.com/iamwrm/image_disk/master/avator.jpg)
```

Then my avator image shows up

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamwrm/image_disk/master/avator.jpg)

## BTW
If you just want to insert a file in your repo's readme file,
you can just use this markdown syntax:

```
![](avator.jpg)
```
![](avator.jpg)

It works both locally and on github, in other words,
 you don't always need Internet access.
